OUTLINE & IDEAS
===============

- Zelda + Harvest Moon + Pokemon -> ???
	- RPG style game.
	- Treasure -> random loot (this means an inventory system)
	- Story line?
	
LEFT TO DO (MAIN):
=================
	- Mob classes
		- Images, animation, levels, etc.
		-> shops (salesman!)
	- Storyline
	- Story line -> level design.
	- Develop battle mechanics.
		- Pokemon-styled fights.
	- Randomized chest loot?
		- Perhaps not random!
		- Store extra hearts -> more max health? (Zelda)?
	- More items
	- FIX THE EXP, STUPID.
	- Minimap (xxmarekxx_x)
	- Battlelog (xxmarekxx_x)
	- Chest closed sprite (ro88ie)
	
	
BATTLE SYSTEM:
==============
	- Stab (Strength) -> Generally higher hits, low critical hit chance.
		- CALCULATION:
			- attackPoints = 4x * (y / rand)
			- x = level
			- y = strength points
	- Slash (Dexterity) -> Generally medium hits, higher critical hit chance.
		- 
	- Block (Defense) -> Limit opponent's next attack.
		- 
	- Inventory (Get stuff)
		-
	- Run (whimpy)
		- Cost XP (less XP than if lost)
		- Cost $$ (More than if you lost)
